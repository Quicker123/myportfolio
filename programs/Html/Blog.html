		Technology is changing and improving day by day. It has great impact on our daily lives. It has increased the connection between peoples. In my case, there are some major field in which technology has direct impact.<br> <br>
		<b class = "small-heading">1.	&nbsp; Communication:</b><br>
		There is great impact of technology in communication, as due to the recent advancement of the technology like internet, smartphone, it is easy to be in touch with people. I talk daily with my sister from New York and it feels like she is with me a mile away. I can chat with my friends anytime and even I can submit coursework from home. There are many things that technology has made easy to do and it is still improving. 
		It has negative effect also as sometimes I cannot give time to important things due to maximum use of social media. It can easily distract anyone but we must use it in a proper way. It is fun to use social media to be in touch with people but it can be harmful to our social skills. People should spend quality time with friends and family for memorable experiences which is important for happiness.<br><br>
   
		<b class = "small-heading">2.	&nbsp; Transportation:</b><br>
		Another major field is transportation, technology has transformed the way I used to travel. Before, I had to wait for a bus to travel short distance and it takes half an hour. But, now there are many safari which has helped me in transportation. Due to the advancement of different kinds of vehicle it has become easy for me to travel many places. A months ago I had booked a trip package to Mustang with and gave my location. Next day, a bus came and I went for a week. So, I cannot imagine a life without transportation but now many of the vehicle are shifting towards electrical engine which id also the good sign of protecting nature.<br><br>

		<b class="small-heading">3. &nbsp;Education:</b><br>
		Major field for student is Education and technology has totally dominated the way we study now. As the full courses of LMU are technology based, there are different lecture class where we read from lecture slides. Each and every component in education field is benefited by technology. The device I use everyday laptops, mobile has helped me to learn in productive way. There are different online courses I had took and many more tutorial I had watched are only possible due the advancement of the technology. I can access the class videos of the Harvard, MIT through different social medium just by sitting at home. Hence, technology has great impact on our daily lives.<br> <br>

		<b class="small-heading">4.	&nbsp; Health:</b><br>
		The important aspect of human life is to be healthy. Every people are conscious about their daily meals and many more thing related to health. Whenever, I have an issue regarding my body then I search for it in google where I find the article written by well known specialist. And I apply those methods and it works for me.
		I research about different tablets after getting medicine from doctors. There are many different ways we are using technology for improving our health. We donâ€™t have to be doctors to know about the different diseases as one can research about it. Once, I had took online medication about being healthy which has helped me till now. Human body are affected in different way, we must be fit mentally and physically.<br>
